### About me 💯

- 🕶️ You can call me "**pc**", but please quote me as "**pcaversaccio**" (`/pi ka.verˈsattʃo/`) (no capitalisation or typos).
- 🔭 I'm currently working on **what's next**.
- 🔧 My day (and sometimes night) job is to help safeguard the Ethereum ecosystem.
- ❤️ Generally, I'm truly passionate about **privacy**, **security**, **cryptography**, **distributed systems**, and **OSS engineering**.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning not to go insane – broadly speaking.
- 💬 Ask me about anything – maybe I can help you; most likely not.
- ⚡ Fun fact: It took less code to send a man to the moon than to run a smartphone.
